EASEA Quick Installation Guidelines
-----------------------------------

1. Check dependencies: the following packages must be installed:

g++ compiler
libboost: to install it on ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev

2. EASEA source code:

The source code can be obtained either from sourceforge or, for
programmers involved in the EASEA development, from its GIT repository.

2.1 Downloading it from sourceforge:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/easea/

2.2 Retrieving it from GIT (for developers in the EASEA team only):

generating a public-private SSH-RSA key pair:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

make sure that your public SSH is registered with the manager of the
repository (currently Ogier Maitre), and that he has granted access to
you.

retrieving the latest version from the GIT repository:

git clone git@atia.u-strasbg.fr:easea.git

3. Compiling EASEA:

cd <EASEAdir>
make
export EZ_PATH=`pwd`/

4. Running an example:

cd examples/weierstrass_std/
$EZ_PATH/easea weierstrass.ez
make
./weierstrass
